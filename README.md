# The Lonely Moon
Ludum Dare 42 Game Jam

## Blurb
When astronomers noticed the moon getting a bit closer, they thought it was cute. "The Moon is lonely!", they said. "It's coming to give us a hug!". Only you understood what it means - that if the Moon gets too close, then the Earth's days are numbered...

Once you realised what to do, you quickly founded a start-up to build satellites and rockets, with the secret goal of building the ultimate space ship - The Ark. The Ark will be the ship to sail civilisation to another world (and most importantly, save you). The plan is simple - you will put satellites into orbit, and use the income they generate to fund research and development for The Ark. But be warned - things might not go quite to plan. Your satellites could collide and create fields of debris. The moon's gravity could modify your trajectories, and send your satellites spinning away. Antagonistic space agencies could shoot you down, and really ruin your day. You might quickly find yourself running out of space...
