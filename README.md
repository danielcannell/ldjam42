# Ludum Dare 42 Game Jam

## Blurb
When astronomers noticed the moon getting a bit closer, they thought it was cute. "The Moon is lonely!", they said. "It's coming to give us a hug!". Only you understood what it meant - that if the Moon gets too close closer, then the Earth's days were numbered...

Once you realised what to do, you quickly founded a start-up to build satellites and rockets - with the secret goal of building an Ark to save as many people as possible (and yourself, of course). The plan is simple - you will put satellites into orbit, and then use the income they generate to fund research and development for the Ark. But be warned - things might not go quite to plan. Between your satellites colliding and creating fields of debris, the moon's gravity messing with your satellites and antagonistic space agencies shooting you down, you might quickly find yourself running out of space...
